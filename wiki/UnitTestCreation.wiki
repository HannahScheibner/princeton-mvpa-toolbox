= Writing Unit Tests =

There are a few minimal requirements to setting up a new test from the standpoint of the framework and execution in a general sense.

== Function Declaration ==

The function declaration has to include returns for the structures _errs_ and _warns_.  These structures are arrays of strings utilized for storing messages of each type from the unit test itself.

{{{
function [errs warns] = unit_test(varargin)
}}}
