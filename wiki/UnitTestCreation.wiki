= Writing Unit Tests =

There are a few minimal requirements to setting up a new test from the standpoint of the framework and execution in a general sense.

== Function Declaration ==

The function declaration has to include returns for the structures _errs_ and _warns_.  These structures are arrays of strings utilized for storing messages of each type from the unit test itself.

{{{
function [errs warns] = unit_test(varargin)
}}}

== Function Structure ==

Declare local copies of the _errs_ and _warns_ as follows.  This allows you to simply append to the end of the list with sub-functions through simple string returns.

{{{
errs = {};
warns = {};

[errs{end+1} warns{end+1}] = test_case_x(args);
}}}
