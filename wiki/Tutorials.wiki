[:TutorialIntro:Introductory] - Essential reading.  This will give you a basic introduction to the way MVPA works, and what you can do with it. Many of the other tutorials build on the SUBJ structure that this tutorial builds.

 * [:TutorialIntroSPM:SPM based Intro] - The same tutorial as above except handling spm files instead of afni briks.

[:TutorialAdv:Advanced] - A series of short guides showing in-depth how to do several common tasks. Definitely worth reading.

[:TutorialAvg:Averaging] - A brief tutorial on how to average timepoints together.

[:TutorialAfniGlm:Using AFNI's GLM (3dDeconvolve) for voxel selection]. This talks you through n-1 feature selection using AFNI's general linear model, all being controlled by the MVPA toolbox from within Matlab.

[:TutorialClass:Classification-related tips and tricks].

 * [:TutorialImportanceMaps:Creating 'importance maps' based on classifier weights]

 * [:TutorialSpheres:Spherical searchlights] for voxel selection and brain maps.
 
 * [:TutorialBoosting:Using AdaBoost for classification]

[:TutorialEBC:EBC tutorial] - For those who participated in the [http://www.ebc.pitt.edu EBC competition] or want another dataset to work with.  This will guide you through using the [:ExpansionEBC:EBC Expansion] to the MVPA Toolbox.

[:TutorialVisualization:Visualizing your data] in various ways.

[:TutorialUnitTesting:Writing unit tests for MVPA functions]
